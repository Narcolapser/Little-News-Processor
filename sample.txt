Proverbs
Chapter 24
24:1 Do not envy evil people,
do not desire to be with them;

24:2 for their hearts contemplate violence,
and their lips speak harm.

24:3 By wisdom a house is built,
and through understanding it is established;

24:4 by knowledge its rooms are filled
with all kinds of precious and pleasing treasures.

24:5 A wise warrior is strong,
and a man of knowledge makes his strength stronger;

24:6 for with guidance you wage your war,
and with numerous advisers there is victory.

24:7 Wisdom is unattainable for a fool;
in court he does not open his mouth.

24:8 The one who plans to do evil
will be called a scheming person.

24:9 A foolish scheme is sin,
and the scorner is an abomination to people.

24:10 If you faint in the day of trouble,
your strength is small!

24:11 Deliver those being taken away to death,
and hold back those slipping to the slaughter.

24:12 If you say, “But we did not know about this,”
does not the one who evaluates hearts consider?
Does not the one who guards your life know?
Will he not repay each person according to his deeds?

24:13 Eat honey, my child, for it is good,
and honey from the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.

24:14 Likewise, know that wisdom is sweet to your soul;
if you find it, you will have a future,
and your hope will not be cut off.

24:15 Do not lie in wait like the wicked against the place where the righteous live;
do not assault his home.

24:16 Although a righteous person may fall seven times, he gets up again,
but the wicked will be brought down by calamity.

24:17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,
and when he stumbles do not let your heart rejoice,

24:18 lest the Lord see it, and be displeased,
and turn his wrath away from him.

24:19 Do not fret because of evil people
or be envious of wicked people,

24:20 for the evil person has no future,
and the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.

24:21 Fear the Lord, my child, as well as the king,
and do not associate with rebels,

24:22 for suddenly their destruction will overtake them,
and who knows the ruinous judgment both the Lord and the king can bring?
Further Sayings of the Wise

24:23 These sayings also are from the wise:
To show partiality in judgment is terrible:

24:24 The one who says to the guilty, “You are innocent,”
peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him.

24:25 But there will be delight for those who convict the guilty,
and a pleasing blessing will come on them.

24:26 Like a kiss on the lips
is the one who gives an honest answer. 

24:27 Establish your work outside and get your fields ready;
afterward build your house.

24:28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,
and do not deceive with your words.

24:29 Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me;
I will pay him back according to what he has done.”

24:30 I passed by the field of a sluggard,
by the vineyard of one who lacks wisdom.

24:31 I saw that thorns had grown up all over it, 
the ground was covered with weeds,
and its stone wall was broken down.

24:32 When I saw this, I gave careful consideration to it;
I received instruction from what I saw:

24:33 “A little sleep, a little slumber,
a little folding of the hands to relax,

24:34 and your poverty will come like a bandit,
and your need like an armed robber.”




1 Samuel
Chapter 24

David Spares Saul’s Life

24:1 (24:2) When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, they told him, “Look, David is in the desert of En Gedi.” 24:2 So Saul took three thousand select men from all Israel and went to find David and his men in the region of the rocks of the mountain goats. 24:3 He came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there was a cave. Saul went into it to relieve himself.

Now David and his men were sitting in the recesses of the cave. 24:4 David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which the Lord said to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hand, and you can do to him whatever seems appropriate to you.’” So David got up and quietly cut off an edge of Saul’s robe. 24:5 Afterward David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off an edge of Saul’s robe. 24:6 He said to his men, “May the Lord keep me far away from doing such a thing to my lord, who is the Lord’s chosen one, by extending my hand against him. After all, he is the Lord’s chosen one.” 24:7 David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and started down the road.

24:8 Afterward David got up and went out of the cave. He called out after Saul, “My lord, O king!” When Saul looked behind him, David kneeled down and bowed with his face to the ground. 24:9 David said to Saul, “Why do you pay attention when men say, ‘David is seeking to do you harm’? 24:10 Today your own eyes see how the Lord delivered you – this very day – into my hands in the cave. Some told me to kill you, but I had pity on you and said, ‘I will not extend my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord’s chosen one.’ 24:11 Look, my father, and see the edge of your robe in my hand! When I cut off the edge of your robe, I didn’t kill you. So realize and understand that I am not planning evil or rebellion. Even though I have not sinned against you, you are waiting in ambush to take my life. 24:12 May the Lord judge between the two of us, and may the Lord vindicate me over you, but my hand will not be against you. 24:13 It’s like the old proverb says: ‘From evil people evil proceeds.’ But my hand will not be against you. 24:14 Who has the king of Israel come out after? Who is it that you are pursuing? A dead dog? A single flea? 24:15 May the Lord be our judge and arbiter. May he see and arbitrate my case and deliver me from your hands!”

24:16 When David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Then Saul wept loudly. 24:17 He said to David, “You are more innocent than I, for you have treated me well, even though I have tried to harm you! 24:18 You have explained today how you have treated me well. The Lord delivered me into your hand, but you did not kill me. 24:19 Now if a man finds his enemy, does he send him on his way in good shape? May the Lord repay you with good this day for what you have done to me. 24:20 Now look, I realize that you will in fact be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 24:21 So now swear to me in the Lord’s name that you will not kill my descendants after me or destroy my name from the house of my father.” 

24:22 David promised Saul this on oath. Then Saul went to his house, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.
