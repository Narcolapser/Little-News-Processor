I have the (gift in jars of clay...) pluggin for gedit I wrote to test modules as I write them. minor problem: it is broken. And the exact problem is being quite alusive. So, some night when I'm on Oxygen not Kodachi I'll need to dive into that and get it working a little better. I would like to use it for this so that I can have tests being run as I write.

Though this does leave me open to some interesting options. I think what I'm going to do is make a master test script in the root. This test script then is responsible for running all the tests against the various pluggins. That would be nice and centeralized. 

I'm going to have the main test script on the root of the directory. This may or may not be the be all end all of testing here. I may later figure out how to include testing as part of the pluggins so that they are entirely self contained, but I will at very leas start here until I'm comforable with tests. I could see two sides to that plan. On the one side: entirely self contained pluggin, makes it easy to drop in place. But does make the file itself more complicated. 

I'm at a cross roads I need to consider. Should I have the ability to sort tests by tags or not. I'm falling asleep. time to call it quits.
