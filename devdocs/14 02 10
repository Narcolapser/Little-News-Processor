I've added another dependency "Mechanize" which also forces me to run in python 2, maybe. Unless I can call a python 2 script from python 3. I can, it is kind of silly to do it that way, but I want to keep this as much as possible in python 3. I'm working towards always doing projects there, but it takes time. The libraries are slowly getting there, but mechanize is not there yet.

Also. I'm adding password support. This is necessary for sites such as caleb that use a password to get in. So I'm adding the *.passwd to the .git-ignore so that password files can be kept seceret and won't get uploaded to git hub. I'll eventually learn how to hash these passwords, but for now I'll just leave it be as raw text. dangerous, yes, I know. But no one has found this project yet and the password file will never get uploaded to the repo.
