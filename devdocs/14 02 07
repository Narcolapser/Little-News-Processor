SO. There is no really good way to author a pdf from python. But I can do an HTML page, and there is a handy tool that converts HTML into PDF. so What I'm going to do is instead, author html pages and have them converted to PDFs. This is one of the joys of having this be a news processor and not just a news reader.

Also, speaking of news. tl;dr seems to have died. wait. never mind. It seems to be back up and running again. *eye roll* welp. good enough. 

I've not got an idea on what my support is thanks to my petra report. I'm so glad to have finally seen that and can finally understand how it works. Finances suddenly make sense and I think I might add finances as one of the things in this system. I'm also thinking of an easier system for keeping track of my finances which would be very friendly to this program. What I'm going to do is instead of trying to give every item a purpose when I get it, unless it has a special purpose, I will enter only the information on the recipt, and let other tabs handle the data processing of that item. In this way I don't think I'll run into the dishabilitating problems I had with my other attempts. With each item on every recipt put in the spread sheet like that, I could do some good data processing. Finances is back in the game. And I may make one for support as well.

gs.stat counting is something I've been watching for a while. It makes me happy to see internet explorer falling off the face of the earth. at this rate firefox will over take it in 10 months! took nearly 2 years after chrome took it's throne. but it is finally happening! I'd like to include gs.stat counting info in the processing as well. I must make this input!

Well, I got pdf output working. But the HTML it reads from is not so good. So I must improve on that, but this means I officially now have the ability to do images and formated text output to my kindle! huge step forward for LNP. improving the HTML out is probably going to be next on the docket.
