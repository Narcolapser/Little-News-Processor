Wow. I've not written anything in the devlog here since february. Anyway. I just finished making a python library that converts petra reports into python objects aswell as json. Now if I can just get it to connect to caleb I can have my support be just another one of the things in my daily personalized news feed. that's pretty nifty. 

I'm starting to see this project develop a little bit of an unwieldy nature. There are a lot of files on the root of this project... But I'm not sure how I could change that. If I go for a folder for each API then I've not necesasarily simplified it. Though it is the only organizaton method that makes sense. I was thinking about sorting it by thing it did, like all the bible pluggin here, all the petra pluggin there, but that completely defies the idea of the project.

So playing with that idea in my head, it actually sounds kinda like a good plan, putting each api in its own group, but here's the thing I can't get past, how do I load a python module in a different folder?

appearently yes:

from inputAPIs.bibleIn import *

This would though lead to a problem, multiple "fetch" commands. hrum.

ok. here's what I found:

>>> from Little-New-Processor.petra Import Report

failed. and so did anything with a hyphen in it. So I tried again making test.py in the devdocs folder.

>>> from devdocs.test import Test
>>> dir()
['other stuff','Test']

>>> import decdovs.test
>>> dir()
['other stuff','devdocs']
>>> dir('devdocs')
['test']

>>> from devdocs.test import *
>>> dir()
['other stuff','Test']

>>> from devdocs import test
>>> dir()
['other stuff','test']
>>> dir('test')
['Test']

HAHA! that last one is briliant! So I'll be able to do something like:
from inputs import bibleIn.py
and then I can address everything in bibleIn.py as bibleIn.*! woohoo! sorting works. SORTING NOW!


	dailyNews.html  firstNetwork.py      offlineData.py     sample.txt
	dailyNews.pdf   inputs               offlineNetwork.py  secondNetwork.py
	dailyNews.txt   kindleNetwork.py     outputs            setuptools-2.2.tar.gz
	devdocs         LICENSE              processors         test_petra.py
	dn.pdf          makefile             README
	fetches         offlineDataMaker.py  README.md

What's setup tools doing here? huh. well. gone now! and now time to go play TA with bready. woohoo!
