Proverbs
Chapter 1

Introduction to the Book

1:1 The Proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:

1:2 To learn wisdom and moral instruction, 

and to discern wise counsel.

1:3 To receive moral instruction in skillful living,

in righteousness, justice, and equity.

1:4 To impart shrewdness to the morally naive,

and a discerning plan to the young person.

1:5 (Let the wise also hear and gain instruction, 

and let the discerning acquire guidance!)

1:6 To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable,

the sayings of the wise and their riddles.

Introduction to the Theme of the Book

1:7 Fearing the Lord is the beginning of moral knowledge,

but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 

1:8 Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father,

and do not forsake the teaching from your mother.

1:9 For they will be like an elegant garland on your head,

and like pendants around your neck.

Admonition to Avoid Easy but Unjust Riches

1:10 My child, if sinners try to entice you,

do not consent!

1:11 If they say, “Come with us!

We will lie in wait to shed blood;

we will ambush an innocent person capriciously.

1:12 We will swallow them alive like Sheol,

those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit.

1:13 We will seize all kinds of precious wealth;

we will fill our houses with plunder.

1:14 Join with us! 

We will all share equally in what we steal.”

1:15 My child, do not go down their way,

withhold yourself from their path; 

1:16 for they are eager to inflict harm,

and they hasten to shed blood.

1:17 Surely it is futile to spread a net

in plain sight of any bird,

1:18 but these men lie in wait for their own blood,

they ambush their own lives!

1:19 Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly; 

it takes away the life of those who obtain it! 

Warning Against Disregarding Wisdom

1:20 Wisdom calls out in the street, 

she shouts loudly in the plazas;

1:21 at the head of the noisy streets she calls,

in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words:

1:22 “How long will you simpletons love naiveté?

How long will mockers delight in mockery

and fools hate knowledge?

1:23 If only you will respond to my rebuke,

then I will pour out my thoughts to you

and I will make my words known to you.

1:24 However, because I called but you refused to listen,

because I stretched out my hand but no one paid attention,

1:25 because you neglected all my advice,

and did not comply with my rebuke,

1:26 so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you,

I will mock when what you dread comes,

1:27 when what you dread comes like a whirlwind,

and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm,

when distressing trouble comes on you.

1:28 Then they will call to me, but I will not answer;

they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me.

1:29 Because they hated moral knowledge,

and did not choose to fear the Lord,

1:30 they did not comply with my advice,

they spurned all my rebuke.

1:31 Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way,

and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel.

1:32 For the waywardness of the 

simpletons will kill them, 

and the careless ease of fools will destroy them.

1:33 But the one who listens to me will live in security,

and will be at ease from the dread of harm.

Proverbs
Chapter 2

Benefits of Seeking Wisdom

2:1 My child, if you receive my words,

and store up my commands within you,

2:2 by making your ear attentive to wisdom, 

and by turning your heart to understanding,

2:3 indeed, if you call out for discernment – 

raise your voice for understanding – 

2:4 if you seek it like silver,

and search for it like hidden treasure,

2:5 then you will understand how to fear the Lord,

and you will discover knowledge about God.

2:6 For the Lord gives wisdom,

and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.

2:7 He stores up effective counsel for the upright,

and is like a shield for those who live with integrity,

2:8 to guard the paths of the righteous

and to protect the way of his pious ones.

2:9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice

and equity – every good way.

2:10 For wisdom will enter your heart,

and moral knowledge will be attractive to you.

2:11 Discretion will protect you,

understanding will guard you,

2:12 to deliver you from the way of the wicked,

from those speaking perversity,

2:13 who leave the upright paths

to walk on the dark ways,

2:14 who delight in doing evil,

they rejoice in perverse evil;

2:15 whose paths are morally crooked,

and who are devious in their ways;

2:16 to deliver you from the adulteress,

from the sexually loose woman who speaks flattering words;

2:17 who leaves the husband from her younger days,

and forgets her marriage covenant made before God. 

2:18 For her house sinks down to death, 

and her paths lead to the place of the departed spirits.

2:19 None who go in to her will return, 

nor will they reach the paths of life.

2:20 So you will walk in the way of good people,

and will keep on the paths of the righteous.

2:21 For the upright will reside in the land,

and those with integrity will remain in it,

2:22 but the wicked will be removed from the land,

and the treacherous will be torn away from it.

Proverbs
Chapter 3

Exhortations to Seek Wisdom and Walk with the Lord

3:1 My child, do not forget my teaching,

but let your heart keep my commandments,

3:2 for they will provide a long and full life,

and they will add well-being to you.

3:3 Do not let truth and mercy leave you;

bind them around your neck,

write them on the tablet of your heart.

3:4 Then you will find favor and good understanding,

in the sight of God and people.

3:5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart,

and do not rely on your own understanding. 

3:6 Acknowledge him in all your ways, 

and he will make your paths straight.

3:7 Do not be wise in your own estimation;

fear the Lord and turn away from evil.

3:8 This will bring healing to your body,

and refreshment to your inner self.

3:9 Honor the Lord from your wealth

and from the first fruits of all your crops;

3:10 then your barns will be filled completely, 

and your vats will overflow with new wine.

3:11 My child, do not despise discipline from the Lord,

and do not loathe his rebuke.

3:12 For the Lord disciplines those he loves,

just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.

Blessings of Obtaining Wisdom

3:13 Blessed is the one who finds wisdom,

and the one who obtains understanding.

3:14 For her benefit is more profitable than silver,

and her gain is better than gold.

3:15 She is more precious than rubies,

and none of the things you desire can compare with her.

3:16 Long life is in her right hand;

in her left hand are riches and honor.

3:17 Her ways are very pleasant,

and all her paths are peaceful.

3:18 She is like a tree of life to those who obtain her,

and everyone who grasps hold of her will be blessed. 

3:19 By wisdom the Lord laid the foundation of the earth;

he established the heavens by understanding. 

3:20 By his knowledge the primordial sea was broken open,

and the clouds drip down dew.

3:21 My child, do not let them escape from your sight;

safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.

3:22 So they will give life to you,

and grace to adorn your neck.

3:23 Then you will walk on your way with security,

and you will not stumble.

3:24 When you lie down you will not be filled with fear;

when you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.

3:25 You will not be afraid of sudden disaster, 

or when destruction overtakes the wicked; 

3:26 for the Lord will be the source of your confidence,

and he will guard your foot from being caught in a trap.

Wisdom Demonstrated in Relationships with People

3:27 Do not withhold good from those who need it,

when you have the ability to help.

3:28 Do not say to your neighbor, “Go! Return tomorrow

and I will give it,” when you have it with you at the time.

3:29 Do not plot evil against your neighbor

when he dwells by you unsuspectingly.

3:30 Do not accuse anyone without legitimate cause,

if he has not treated you wrongly.

3:31 Do not envy a violent man,

and do not choose to imitate any of his ways;

3:32 for one who goes astray is an abomination to the Lord, 

but he reveals his intimate counsel to the upright. 

3:33 The Lord’s curse is on the household of the wicked,

but he blesses the home of the righteous.

3:34 Although he is scornful to arrogant scoffers,

yet he shows favor to the humble.

3:35 The wise inherit honor,

but he holds fools up to public contempt.

Proverbs
Chapter 4

Admonition to Follow Righteousness and Avoid Wickedness

4:1 Listen, children, to a father’s instruction,

and pay attention so that you may gain discernment.

4:2 Because I give you good instruction,

do not forsake my teaching.

4:3 When I was a son to my father,

a tender only child before my mother,

4:4 he taught me, and he said to me:

“Let your heart lay hold of my words;

keep my commands so that you will live.

4:5 Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding;

do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak.

4:6 Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;

love her, and she will guard you.

4:7 Wisdom is supreme – so acquire wisdom,

and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding!

4:8 Esteem her highly and she will exalt you;

she will honor you if you embrace her.

4:9 She will place a fair garland on your head;

she will bestow a beautiful crown on you.”

4:10 Listen, my child, and accept my words,

so that the years of your life will be many.

4:11 I will guide you in the way of wisdom

and I will lead you in upright paths.

4:12 When you walk, your steps will not be hampered,

and when you run, you will not stumble.

4:13 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;

protect it, because it is your life.

4:14 Do not enter the path of the wicked

or walk in the way of those who are evil.

4:15 Avoid it, do not go on it;

turn away from it, and go on.

4:16 For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm;

they are robbed of sleep until they make someone stumble.

4:17 For they eat bread gained from wickedness

and drink wine obtained from violence.

4:18 But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light,

growing brighter and brighter until full day.

4:19 The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness;

they do not know what causes them to stumble.

4:20 My child, pay attention to my words;

listen attentively to my sayings.

4:21 Do not let them depart from your sight,

guard them within your heart;

4:22 for they are life to those who find them 

and healing to one’s entire body.

4:23 Guard your heart with all vigilance,

for from it are the sources of life.

4:24 Remove perverse speech from your mouth;

keep devious talk far from your lips.

4:25 Let your eyes look directly in front of you

and let your gaze look straight before you.

4:26 Make the path for your feet level, 

so that all your ways may be established.

4:27 Do not turn to the right or to the left;

turn yourself away from evil.

Proverbs
Chapter 5

Admonition to Avoid Seduction to Evil

5:1 My child, be attentive to my wisdom,

pay close attention to my understanding,

5:2 in order to safeguard discretion,

and that your lips may guard knowledge.

5:3 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,

and her seductive words are smoother than olive oil,

5:4 but in the end she is bitter as wormwood,

sharp as a two-edged sword.

5:5 Her feet go down to death;

her steps lead straight to the grave.

5:6 Lest she should make level the path leading to life,

her paths are unstable but she does not know it.

5:7 So now, children, listen to me;

do not turn aside from the words I speak.

5:8 Keep yourself far from her,

and do not go near the door of her house,

5:9 lest you give your vigor to others 

and your years to a cruel person,

5:10 lest strangers devour your strength,

and your labor benefit another man’s house.

5:11 And at the end of your life you will groan

when your flesh and your body are wasted away.

5:12 And you will say, “How I hated discipline!

My heart spurned reproof!

5:13 For I did not obey my teachers

and I did not heed my instructors.

5:14 I almost came to complete ruin

in the midst of the whole congregation!”

5:15 Drink water from your own cistern

and running water from your own well.

5:16 Should your springs be dispersed outside,

your streams of water in the wide plazas?

5:17 Let them be for yourself alone,

and not for strangers with you.

5:18 May your fountain be blessed,

and may you rejoice in your young wife – 

5:19 a loving doe, a graceful deer;

may her breasts satisfy you at all times,

may you be captivated by her love always.

5:20 But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress,

and embrace the bosom of a different woman?

5:21 For the ways of a person are in front of the Lord’s eyes,

and the Lord weighs all that person’s paths.

5:22 The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities,

and he will be held by the cords of his own sin.

5:23 He will die because there was no discipline;

because of the greatness of his folly he will reel. 

Proverbs
Chapter 6

Admonitions and Warnings against Dangerous and Destructive Acts

6:1 My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor,

and have become a guarantor for a stranger,

6:2 if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered,

and have been caught by the words you have spoken,

6:3 then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself,

because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power:

go, humble yourself,

and appeal firmly to your neighbor.

6:4 Permit no sleep to your eyes

or slumber to your eyelids.

6:5 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare,

and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.

6:6 Go to the ant, you sluggard;

observe its ways and be wise!

6:7 It has no commander, 

overseer, or ruler,

6:8 yet it prepares its food in the summer;

it gathers at the harvest what it will eat.

6:9 How long, you sluggard, will you lie there?

When will you rise from your sleep?

6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber,

a little folding of the hands to relax,

6:11 and your poverty will come like a robber,

and your need like an armed man.

6:12 A worthless and wicked person

walks around saying perverse things;

6:13 he winks with his eyes,

signals with his feet,

and points with his fingers;

6:14 he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart,

he spreads contention at all times.

6:15 Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly;

in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.

6:16 There are six things that the Lord hates,

even seven things that are an abomination to him:

6:17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue,

and hands that shed innocent blood,

6:18 a heart that devises wicked plans,

feet that are swift to run to evil,

6:19 a false witness who pours out lies,

and a person who spreads discord among family members.

6:20 My child, guard the commands of your father

and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.

6:21 Bind them on your heart continually;

fasten them around your neck.

6:22 When you walk about, they will guide you; 

when you lie down, they will watch over you;

when you wake up, they will talk to you.

6:23 For the commandments are like a lamp,

instruction is like a light,

and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,

6:24 by keeping you from the evil woman,

from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.

6:25 Do not lust in your heart for her beauty,

and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;

6:26 for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread,

but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.

6:27 Can a man hold fire against his chest

without burning his clothes?

6:28 Can a man walk on hot coals

without scorching his feet? 

6:29 So it is with the one who has sex with his neighbor’s wife;

no one who touches her will escape punishment.

6:30 People do not despise a thief when he steals

to fulfill his need when he is hungry.

6:31 Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over,

he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.

6:32 A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks wisdom,

whoever does it destroys his own life.

6:33 He will be beaten and despised,

and his reproach will not be wiped away;

6:34 for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage,

and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.

6:35 He will not consider any compensation;

he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation. 

Proverbs
Chapter 7

Admonition to Avoid the Wiles of the Adulteress

7:1 My child, keep my words

and treasure up my commands in your own keeping.

7:2 Keep my commands so that you may live,

and obey my instruction as your most prized possession.

7:3 Bind them on your forearm;

write them on the tablet of your heart.

7:4 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”

and call understanding a close relative,

7:5 so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman,

from the loose woman who flatters you with her words.

7:6 For at the window of my house

through my window lattice I looked out 

7:7 and I saw among the naive – 

I discerned among the youths – 

a young man who lacked wisdom.

7:8 He was passing by the street near her corner,

making his way along the road to her house

7:9 in the twilight, the evening,

in the dark of the night. 

7:10 Suddenly a woman came out to meet him!

She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent. 

7:11 (She is loud and rebellious,

she does not remain at home – 

7:12 at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas,

and by every corner she lies in wait.)

7:13 So she grabbed him and kissed him,

and with a bold expression she said to him,

7:14 “I have fresh meat at home;

today I have fulfilled my vows!

7:15 That is why I came out to meet you,

to look for you, and I found you!

7:16 I have spread my bed with elegant coverings,

with richly colored fabric from Egypt.

7:17 I have perfumed my bed 

with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

7:18 Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning,

let’s delight ourselves with sexual intercourse.

7:19 For my husband is not at home; 

he has gone on a journey of some distance.

7:20 He has taken a bag of money with him;

he will not return until the end of the month.”

7:21 She persuaded him with persuasive words;

with her smooth talk she compelled him.

7:22 Suddenly he went after her

like an ox that goes to the slaughter,

like a stag prancing into a trapper’s snare

7:23 till an arrow pierces his liver – 

like a bird hurrying into a trap,

and he does not know that it will cost him his life.

7:24 So now, sons, listen to me,

and pay attention to the words I speak.

7:25 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways – 

do not wander into her pathways;

7:26 for she has brought down many fatally wounded,

and all those she has slain are many.

7:27 Her house is the way to the grave,

going down to the chambers of death.

Proverbs
Chapter 8

The Appeal of Wisdom

8:1 Does not wisdom call out?

Does not understanding raise her voice?

8:2 At the top of the elevated places along the way,

at the intersection of the paths she takes her stand;

8:3 beside the gates opening into the city,

at the entrance of the doorways she cries out:

8:4 “To you, O people, I call out,

and my voice calls to all mankind.

8:5 You who are naive, discern wisdom!

And you fools, understand discernment!

8:6 Listen, for I will speak excellent things,

and my lips will utter what is right.

8:7 For my mouth speaks truth,

and my lips hate wickedness.

8:8 All the words of my mouth are righteous;

there is nothing in them twisted or crooked.

8:9 All of them are clear to the discerning

and upright to those who find knowledge.

8:10 Receive my instruction rather than silver,

and knowledge rather than choice gold.

8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies,

and desirable things cannot be compared to her.

8:12 “I, wisdom, live with prudence,

and I find knowledge and discretion.

8:13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil;

I hate arrogant pride and the evil way

and perverse utterances. 

8:14 Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me;

I possess understanding and might.

8:15 Kings reign by means of me,

and potentates decree righteousness;

8:16 by me princes rule,

as well as nobles and all righteous judges.

8:17 I love those who love me,

and those who seek me find me.

8:18 Riches and honor are with me,

long-lasting wealth and righteousness.

8:19 My fruit is better than the purest gold,

and what I produce is better than choice silver.

8:20 I walk in the path of righteousness,

in the pathway of justice,

8:21 that I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth,

and that I may fill their treasuries.

8:22 The Lord created me as the beginning of his works,

before his deeds of long ago.

8:23 From eternity I was appointed,

from the beginning, from before the world existed.

8:24 When there were no deep oceans I was born,

when there were no springs overflowing with water;

8:25 before the mountains were set in place – 

before the hills – I was born,

8:26 before he made the earth and its fields,

or the beginning of the dust of the world.

8:27 When he established the heavens, I was there;

when he marked out the horizon over the face of the deep,

8:28 when he established the clouds above,

when the fountains of the deep grew strong,

8:29 when he gave the sea his decree

that the waters should not pass over his command,

when he marked out the foundations of the earth,

8:30 then I was beside him as a master craftsman,

and I was his delight day by day,

rejoicing before him at all times,

8:31 rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth,

and delighting in its people. 

8:32 “So now, children, listen to me;

blessed are those who keep my ways.

8:33 Listen to my instruction so that you may be wise,

and do not neglect it.

8:34 Blessed is the one who listens to me,

watching at my doors day by day,

waiting beside my doorway.

8:35 For the one who finds me finds life

and receives favor from the Lord. 

8:36 But the one who does not find me brings harm to himself;

all who hate me love death.”

Proverbs
Chapter 9

The Consequences of Accepting Wisdom or Folly

9:1 Wisdom has built her house;

she has carved out its seven pillars.

9:2 She has prepared her meat, she has mixed her wine;

she also has arranged her table.

9:3 She has sent out her female servants;

she calls out on the highest places of the city.

9:4 “Whoever is naive, let him turn in here,”

she says to those who lack understanding.

9:5 “Come, eat some of my food,

and drink some of the wine I have mixed.

9:6 Abandon your foolish ways so that you may live,

and proceed in the way of understanding.”

9:7 Whoever corrects a mocker is asking for insult;

whoever reproves a wicked person receives abuse.

9:8 Do not reprove a mocker or he will hate you;

reprove a wise person and he will love you.

9:9 Give instruction to a wise person, and he will become wiser still;

teach a righteous person and he will add to his learning.

9:10 The beginning of wisdom is to fear the Lord,

and acknowledging the Holy One is understanding.

9:11 For because of me your days will be many,

and years will be added to your life. 

9:12 If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage,

but if you are a mocker, you alone must bear it. 

9:13 The woman called Folly is brash,

she is naive and does not know anything.

9:14 So she sits at the door of her house,

on a seat at the highest point of the city,

9:15 calling out to those who are passing by her in the way,

who go straight on their way. 

9:16 “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here,”

she says to those who lack understanding.

9:17 “Stolen waters are sweet,

and food obtained in secret is pleasant!”

9:18 But they do not realize that the dead are there,

that her guests are in the depths of the grave.

Proverbs
Chapter 10

The First Collection of Solomonic Proverbs

10:1 The Proverbs of Solomon:

A wise child makes a father rejoice,

but a foolish child is a grief to his mother.

10:2 Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit,

but righteousness delivers from mortal danger.

10:3 The Lord satisfies the appetite of the righteous,

but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.

10:4 The one who is lazy becomes poor,

but the one who works diligently becomes wealthy.

10:5 The one who gathers crops in the summer is a wise son,

but the one who sleeps during the harvest 

is a son who brings shame to himself.

10:6 Blessings are on the head of the righteous,

but the speech of the wicked conceals violence.

10:7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing,

but the reputation of the wicked will rot.

10:8 The wise person accepts instructions,

but the one who speaks foolishness will come to ruin.

10:9 The one who conducts himself in integrity will live securely,

but the one who behaves perversely will be found out.

10:10 The one who winks his eye causes trouble,

and the one who speaks foolishness will come to ruin.

10:11 The teaching of the righteous is a fountain of life, 

but the speech of the wicked conceals violence.

10:12 Hatred stirs up dissension,

but love covers all transgressions.

10:13 Wisdom is found in the words of the discerning person, 

but the one who lacks wisdom will be disciplined. 

10:14 Those who are wise store up knowledge,

but foolish speech leads to imminent destruction.

10:15 The wealth of a rich person is like a fortified city,

but the poor are brought to ruin by their poverty.

10:16 The reward which the righteous receive is life;

the recompense which the wicked receive is judgment.

10:17 The one who heeds instruction is on the way to life,

but the one who rejects rebuke goes astray.

10:18 The one who conceals hatred utters lies,

and the one who spreads slander is certainly a fool.

10:19 When words abound, transgression is inevitable,

but the one who restrains his words is wise.

10:20 What the righteous say is like the best silver,

but what the wicked think is of little value.

10:21 The teaching of the righteous feeds many,

but fools die for lack of wisdom.

10:22 The blessing from the Lord makes a person rich,

and he adds no sorrow to it.

10:23 Carrying out a wicked scheme is enjoyable to a fool,

and so is wisdom for the one who has discernment.

10:24 What the wicked fears will come on him;

what the righteous desire will be granted.

10:25 When the storm passes through, the wicked are swept away,

but the righteous are an everlasting foundation.

so at harvest time he looks for the crop but has nothing.

20:5 Counsel in a person’s heart is like deep water,

but an understanding person draws it out.

20:6 Many people profess their loyalty,

but a faithful person – who can find?

20:7 The righteous person behaves in integrity; 

blessed are his children after him.

20:8 A king sitting on the throne to judge

separates out all evil with his eyes.

20:9 Who can say, “I have kept my heart clean;

I am pure from my sin”?

20:10 Diverse weights and diverse measures – 

the Lord abhors both of them.

20:11 Even a young man is known by his actions,

whether his activity is pure and whether it is right.

20:12 The ear that hears and the eye that sees – 

the Lord has made them both.

20:13 Do not love sleep, lest you become impoverished;

open your eyes so that you might be satisfied with food.

20:14 “It’s worthless! It’s worthless!” says the buyer,

but when he goes on his way, he boasts.

20:15 There is gold, and an abundance of rubies,

but words of knowledge are like a precious jewel.

20:16 Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,

and when he gives surety for strangers, hold him in pledge.

20:17 Bread gained by deceit tastes sweet to a person,

but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel.

20:18 Plans are established by counsel,

so make war with guidance.

20:19 The one who goes about gossiping reveals secrets;

therefore do not associate with someone who is always opening his mouth.

20:20 The one who curses his father and his mother,

his lamp will be extinguished in the blackest darkness. 

20:21 An inheritance gained easily in the beginning

will not be blessed in the end.

20:22 Do not say, “I will pay back evil!”

Wait for the Lord, so that he may vindicate you.

20:23 The Lord abhors differing weights,

and dishonest scales are wicked.

20:24 The steps of a person are ordained by the Lord – 

so how can anyone understand his own way?

20:25 It is a snare for a person to rashly cry, “Holy!”

and only afterward to consider what he has vowed.

20:26 A wise king separates out the wicked;

he turns the threshing wheel over them.

20:27 The human spirit is like the lamp of the Lord,

searching all his innermost parts.

20:28 Loyal love and truth preserve a king,

and his throne is upheld by loyal love.

20:29 The glory of young men is their strength,

and the splendor of old men is gray hair.

20:30 Beatings and wounds cleanse away evil,

and floggings cleanse the innermost being.

Proverbs
Chapter 21

21:1 The king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord like channels of water;

he turns it wherever he wants.

21:2 All of a person’s ways seem right in his own opinion,

but the Lord evaluates the motives.

21:3 To do righteousness and justice

is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.

21:4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart – 

the agricultural product of the wicked is sin.

21:5 The plans of the diligent lead only to plenty,

but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.

21:6 Making a fortune by a lying tongue is like a vapor driven back and forth; 

they seek death.

21:7 The violence done by the wicked will drag them away

because they refuse to do what is right.

21:8 The way of the guilty person is devious,

but as for the pure, his way is upright.

21:9 It is better to live on a corner of the housetop

than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.

21:10 The appetite of the wicked desires evil;

his neighbor is shown no favor in his eyes.

21:11 When a scorner is punished, the naive becomes wise;

when a wise person is instructed, he gains knowledge.

21:12 The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked;

he overthrows the wicked to their ruin.

21:13 The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor,

he too will cry out and will not be answered.

21:14 A gift given in secret subdues anger,

and a bribe given secretly subdues strong wrath.

21:15 Doing justice brings joy to the righteous

and terror to those who do evil.

21:16 The one who wanders from the way of wisdom

will end up in the company of the departed.

21:17 The one who loves pleasure will be a poor person;

whoever loves wine and anointing oil will not be rich.

21:18 The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,

and the faithless are taken in the place of the upright.

21:19 It is better to live in a desert land

than with a quarrelsome and easily-provoked woman.

21:20 There is desirable treasure and olive oil in the dwelling of the wise,

but a foolish person devours all he has.

21:21 The one who pursues righteousness and love

finds life, bounty, and honor.

21:22 The wise person can scale the city of the mighty

and bring down the stronghold in which they trust.

21:23 The one who guards his mouth and his tongue

keeps his life from troubles.

21:24 A proud and arrogant person, whose name is “Scoffer,”

acts with overbearing pride.

21:25 What the sluggard desires will kill him,

for his hands refuse to work.

21:26 All day long he craves greedily,

but the righteous gives and does not hold back.

21:27 The wicked person’s sacrifice is an abomination;

how much more when he brings it with evil intent! 

21:28 A lying witness will perish,

but the one who reports accurately speaks forever.

21:29 A wicked person shows boldness with his face,

but as for the upright, he discerns his ways.

21:30 There is no wisdom and there is no understanding,

and there is no counsel against the Lord.

21:31 A horse is prepared for the day of battle,

but the victory is from the Lord.

Proverbs
Chapter 22

22:1 A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth,

good favor more than silver or gold.

22:2 The rich and the poor meet together;

the Lord is the Creator of them both.

22:3 A shrewd person sees danger and hides himself,

but the naive keep right on going and suffer for it.

22:4 The reward for humility and fearing the Lord

is riches and honor and life.

22:5 Thorns and snares are in the path of the perverse,

but the one who guards himself keeps far from them.

22:6 Train a child in the way that he should go,

and when he is old he will not turn from it.

22:7 The rich rule over the poor,

and the borrower is servant to the lender.

22:8 The one who sows iniquity will reap trouble,

and the rod of his fury will end.

22:9 A generous person will be blessed,

for he gives some of his food to the poor.

22:10 Drive out the scorner and contention will leave;

strife and insults will cease.

22:11 The one who loves a pure heart

and whose speech is gracious – the king will be his friend.

22:12 The eyes of the Lord guard knowledge,

but he overthrows the words of the faithless person.

22:13 The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!

I will be killed in the middle of the streets!”

22:14 The mouth of an adulteress is like a deep pit;

the one against whom the Lord is angry will fall into it.

22:15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,

but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him.

22:16 The one who oppresses the poor to increase his own gain

and the one who gives to the rich – both end up only in poverty.

The Sayings of the Wise

22:17 Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise,

and apply your heart to my instruction.

22:18 For it is pleasing if you keep these sayings within you,

and they are ready on your lips.

22:19 So that your confidence may be in the Lord, 

I am making them known to you today – even you.

22:20 Have I not written thirty sayings for you,

sayings of counsel and knowledge,

22:21 to show you true and reliable words,

so that you may give accurate answers to those who sent you?

22:22 Do not exploit a poor person because he is poor

and do not crush the needy in court,

22:23 for the Lord will plead their case

and will rob those who are robbing them.

22:24 Do not make friends with an angry person,

and do not associate with a wrathful person,

22:25 lest you learn his ways

and entangle yourself in a snare.

22:26 Do not be one who strikes hands in pledge

or who puts up security for debts.

22:27 If you do not have enough to pay,

your bed will be taken right out from under you!

22:28 Do not move an ancient boundary stone

which was put in place by your ancestors.

22:29 Do you see a person skilled in his work?

He will take his position before kings;

he will not take his position before obscure people.

Proverbs
Chapter 23

23:1 When you sit down to eat with a ruler,

consider carefully what is before you,

23:2 and put a knife to your throat

if you possess a large appetite.

23:3 Do not crave that ruler’s delicacies,

for that food is deceptive.

23:4 Do not wear yourself out to become rich;

be wise enough to restrain yourself.

23:5 When you gaze upon riches, they are gone,

for they surely make wings for themselves,

and fly off into the sky like an eagle!

23:6 Do not eat the food of a stingy person,

do not crave his delicacies;

23:7 for he is like someone calculating the cost in his mind. 

“Eat and drink,” he says to you,

but his heart is not with you;

23:8 you will vomit up the little bit you have eaten,

and will have wasted your pleasant words.

23:9 Do not speak in the ears of a fool,

for he will despise the wisdom of your words.

23:10 Do not move an ancient boundary stone,

or take over the fields of the fatherless,

23:11 for their Protector is strong;

he will plead their case against you.

23:12 Apply your heart to instruction

and your ears to the words of knowledge.

23:13 Do not withhold discipline from a child;

even if you strike him with the rod, he will not die.

23:14 If you strike him with the rod,

you will deliver him from death.

23:15 My child, if your heart is wise,

then my heart also will be glad;

23:16 my soul will rejoice

when your lips speak what is right.

23:17 Do not let your heart envy sinners,

but rather be zealous in fearing the Lord all the time.

23:18 For surely there is a future,

and your hope will not be cut off. 

23:19 Listen, my child, and be wise,

and guide your heart on the right way.

23:20 Do not spend time among drunkards,

among those who eat too much meat,

23:21 because drunkards and gluttons become impoverished,

and drowsiness clothes them with rags.

23:22 Listen to your father who begot you,

and do not despise your mother when she is old.

23:23 Acquire truth and do not sell it – 

wisdom, and discipline, and understanding.

23:24 The father of a righteous person will rejoice greatly;

whoever fathers a wise child will have joy in him.

23:25 May your father and your mother have joy;

may she who bore you rejoice.

23:26 Give me your heart, my son,

and let your eyes observe my ways;

23:27 for a prostitute is like a deep pit;

a harlot is like a narrow well.

23:28 Indeed, she lies in wait like a robber,

and increases the unfaithful among men. 

23:29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow?

Who has contentions? Who has complaints?

Who has wounds without cause? Who has dullness of the eyes?

23:30 Those who linger over wine,

those who go looking for mixed wine.

23:31 Do not look on the wine when it is red,

when it sparkles in the cup,

when it goes down smoothly.

23:32 Afterward it bites like a snake,

and stings like a viper.

23:33 Your eyes will see strange things,

and your mind will speak perverse things.

23:34 And you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea,

and like one who lies down on the top of the rigging.

23:35 You will say, “They have struck me, but I am not harmed!

They beat me, but I did not know it!

When will I awake? I will look for another drink.”

Proverbs
Chapter 24

24:1 Do not envy evil people,

do not desire to be with them;

24:2 for their hearts contemplate violence,

and their lips speak harm.

24:3 By wisdom a house is built,

and through understanding it is established;

24:4 by knowledge its rooms are filled

with all kinds of precious and pleasing treasures.

24:5 A wise warrior is strong,

and a man of knowledge makes his strength stronger;

24:6 for with guidance you wage your war,

and with numerous advisers there is victory.

24:7 Wisdom is unattainable for a fool;

in court he does not open his mouth.

24:8 The one who plans to do evil

will be called a scheming person.

24:9 A foolish scheme is sin,

and the scorner is an abomination to people.

24:10 If you faint in the day of trouble,

your strength is small!

24:11 Deliver those being taken away to death,

and hold back those slipping to the slaughter.

24:12 If you say, “But we did not know about this,”

does not the one who evaluates hearts consider?

Does not the one who guards your life know?

Will he not repay each person according to his deeds?

24:13 Eat honey, my child, for it is good,

and honey from the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.

24:14 Likewise, know that wisdom is sweet to your soul;

if you find it, you will have a future,

and your hope will not be cut off.

24:15 Do not lie in wait like the wicked against the place where the righteous live;

do not assault his home.

24:16 Although a righteous person may fall seven times, he gets up again,

but the wicked will be brought down by calamity.

24:17 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,

and when he stumbles do not let your heart rejoice,

24:18 lest the Lord see it, and be displeased,

and turn his wrath away from him.

24:19 Do not fret because of evil people

or be envious of wicked people,

24:20 for the evil person has no future,

and the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.

24:21 Fear the Lord, my child, as well as the king,

and do not associate with rebels,

24:22 for suddenly their destruction will overtake them,

and who knows the ruinous judgment both the Lord and the king can bring?

Further Sayings of the Wise

24:23 These sayings also are from the wise:

To show partiality in judgment is terrible:

24:24 The one who says to the guilty, “You are innocent,”

peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him.

24:25 But there will be delight for those who convict the guilty,

and a pleasing blessing will come on them.

24:26 Like a kiss on the lips

is the one who gives an honest answer. 

24:27 Establish your work outside and get your fields ready;

afterward build your house.

24:28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,

and do not deceive with your words.

24:29 Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me;

I will pay him back according to what he has done.”

24:30 I passed by the field of a sluggard,

by the vineyard of one who lacks wisdom.

24:31 I saw that thorns had grown up all over it, 

the ground was covered with weeds,

and its stone wall was broken down.

24:32 When I saw this, I gave careful consideration to it;

I received instruction from what I saw:

24:33 “A little sleep, a little slumber,

a little folding of the hands to relax,

24:34 and your poverty will come like a bandit,

and your need like an armed robber.”

Proverbs
Chapter 25

Proverbs of Solomon Collected by Hezekiah

25:1 These also are proverbs of Solomon,

which the men of King Hezekiah of Judah copied: 

25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,

and it is the glory of a king to search out a matter.

25:3 As the heaven is high and the earth is deep

so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.

25:4 Remove the dross from the silver,

and material for the silversmith will emerge;

25:5 remove the wicked from before the king,

and his throne will be established in righteousness.

25:6 Do not honor yourself before the king,

and do not stand in the place of great men;

25:7 for it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”

than to put you lower before a prince,

whom your eyes have seen.

25:8 Do not go out hastily to litigation,

or what will you do afterward

when your neighbor puts you to shame?

25:9 When you argue a case with your neighbor,

do not reveal the secret of another person,

25:10 lest the one who hears it put you to shame

and your infamy will never go away.

25:11 Like apples of gold in settings of silver,

so is a word skillfully spoken.

25:12 Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold,

so is a wise reprover to the ear of the one who listens.

25:13 Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest,

so is a faithful messenger to those who send him,

for he refreshes the heart of his masters.

25:14 Like cloudy skies and wind that produce no rain,

so is the one who boasts of a gift not given.

25:15 Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,

and a soft tongue can break a bone.

25:16 When you find honey, eat only what is sufficient for you,

lest you become stuffed with it and vomit it up.

25:17 Don’t set foot too frequently in your neighbor’s house,

lest he become weary of you and hate you.

25:18 Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow,

so is the one who testifies against his neighbor as a false witness.

25:19 Like a bad tooth or a foot out of joint,

so is confidence in an unfaithful person at the time of trouble.

25:20 Like one who takes off a garment on a cold day,

or like vinegar poured on soda,

so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.

25:21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,

and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,

25:22 for you will heap coals of fire on his head,

and the Lord will reward you.

25:23 The north wind brings forth rain,

and a gossiping tongue brings forth an angry look.

25:24 It is better to live on a corner of the housetop

than in a house in company with a quarrelsome wife.

25:25 Like cold water to a weary person,

so is good news from a distant land.

25:26 Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,

so is a righteous person who gives way before the wicked.

25:27 It is not good to eat too much honey,

nor is it honorable for people to seek their own glory.

25:28 Like a city that is broken down and without a wall,

so is a person who cannot control his temper.

Proverbs
Chapter 26

26:1 Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,

so honor is not fitting for a fool.

26:2 Like a fluttering bird or like a flying swallow,

so a curse without cause does not come to rest.

26:3 A whip for the horse and a bridle for the donkey,

and a rod for the backs of fools!

26:4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly,

lest you yourself also be like him.

26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly,

lest he be wise in his own estimation.

26:6 Like cutting off the feet or drinking violence,

so is sending a message by the hand of a fool.

26:7 Like legs that hang limp from the lame,

so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.

26:8 Like tying a stone in a sling,

so is giving honor to a fool.

26:9 Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard,

so is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.

26:10 Like an archer who wounds at random,

so is the one who hires a fool or hires any passer-by.

26:11 Like a dog that returns to its vomit,

so a fool repeats his folly.

26:12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?

There is more hope for a fool than for him.

26:13 The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!

A lion in the streets!”

26:14 Like a door that turns on its hinges,

so a sluggard turns on his bed.

26:15 The sluggard plunges his hand in the dish;

he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.

26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own estimation

than seven people who respond with good sense.

26:17 Like one who grabs a wild dog by the ears,

so is the person passing by who becomes furious over a quarrel not his own.

26:18 Like a madman who shoots

firebrands and deadly arrows,

26:19 so is a person who deceives his neighbor,

and says, “Was I not only joking?”

26:20 Where there is no wood, a fire goes out,

and where there is no gossip, contention ceases.

26:21 Like charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,

so is a contentious person to kindle strife.

26:22 The words of a gossip are like delicious morsels;

they go down into a person’s innermost being.

26:23 Like a coating of glaze over earthenware

are fervent lips with an evil heart.

26:24 The one who hates others disguises it with his lips,

but he stores up deceit within him.

26:25 When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,

for there are seven abominations within him. 

26:26 Though his hatred may be concealed by deceit,

his evil will be uncovered in the assembly.

26:27 The one who digs a pit will fall into it;

the one who rolls a stone – it will come back on him.

26:28 A lying tongue hates those crushed by it,

and a flattering mouth works ruin.

Proverbs
Chapter 27

27:1 Do not boast about tomorrow;

for you do not know what a day may bring forth.

27:2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;

someone else, and not your own lips. 

27:3 A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,

but vexation by a fool is more burdensome than the two of them.

27:4 Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,

but who can stand before jealousy?

27:5 Better is open rebuke

than hidden love.

27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend,

but the kisses of an enemy are excessive.

27:7 The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey,

but to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet.

27:8 Like a bird that wanders from its nest,

so is a person who wanders from his home.

27:9 Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice,

likewise the sweetness of one’s friend from sincere counsel.

27:10 Do not forsake your friend and your father’s friend,

and do not enter your brother’s house in the day of your disaster;

a neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.

27:11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,

so that I may answer anyone who taunts me.

27:12 A shrewd person sees danger and hides himself,

but the naive keep right on going and suffer for it.

27:13 Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,

and when he gives surety for a stranger, hold him in pledge.

27:14 If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,

it will be counted as a curse to him.

27:15 A continual dripping on a rainy day

and a contentious wife are alike.

27:16 Whoever hides her hides the wind

or grasps oil with his right hand.

27:17 As iron sharpens iron,

so a person sharpens his friend.

27:18 The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,

and whoever takes care of his master will be honored.

27:19 As in water the face is reflected as a face,

so a person’s heart reflects the person. 

27:20 As Death and Destruction are never satisfied,

so the eyes of a person are never satisfied.

27:21 As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,

so a person is proved by the praise he receives.

27:22 If you should pound the fool in the mortar

among the grain with the pestle,

his foolishness would not depart from him.

27:23 Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks,

give careful attention to your herds,

27:24 for riches do not last forever,

nor does a crown last from generation to generation.

27:25 When the hay is removed and new grass appears,

and the grass from the hills is gathered in,

27:26 the lambs will be for your clothing,

and the goats will be for the price of a field.

27:27 And there will be enough goat’s milk for your food,

for the food of your household,

and for the sustenance of your servant girls.

Proverbs
Chapter 28

28:1 The wicked person flees when there is no one pursuing,

but the righteous person is as confident as a lion.

28:2 When a country is rebellious it has many princes,

but by someone who is discerning and knowledgeable order is maintained.

28:3 A poor person who oppresses the weak

is like a driving rain without food.

28:4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,

but those who keep the law contend with them.

28:5 Evil people do not understand justice,

but those who seek the Lord understand it all.

28:6 A poor person who walks in his integrity is better

than one who is perverse in his ways even though he is rich. 

28:7 The one who keeps the law is a discerning child,

but a companion of gluttons brings shame to his parents.

28:8 The one who increases his wealth by increasing interest

gathers it for someone who is gracious to the needy.

28:9 The one who turns away his ear from hearing the law,

even his prayer is an abomination.

28:10 The one who leads the upright astray in an evil way

will himself fall into his own pit,

but the blameless will inherit what is good.

28:11 A rich person is wise in his own eyes,

but a discerning poor person can evaluate him properly.

28:12 When the righteous rejoice, great is the glory,

but when the wicked rise to power, people are sought out.

28:13 The one who covers his transgressions will not prosper,

but whoever confesses them and forsakes them will find mercy.

28:14 Blessed is the one who is always cautious,

but whoever hardens his heart will fall into evil.

28:15 Like a roaring lion or a roving bear,

so is a wicked ruler over a poor people.

28:16 The prince who is a great oppressor lacks wisdom,

but the one who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.

28:17 The one who is tormented by the murder of another will flee to the pit; 

let no one support him.

28:18 The one who walks blamelessly will be delivered,

but whoever is perverse in his ways will fall at once. 

28:19 The one who works his land will be satisfied with food,

but whoever chases daydreams will have his fill of poverty.

28:20 A faithful person will have an abundance of blessings,

but the one who hastens to gain riches will not go unpunished.

28:21 To show partiality is terrible,

for a person will transgress over the smallest piece of bread.

28:22 The stingy person hastens after riches

and does not know that poverty will overtake him.

28:23 The one who reproves another will in the end find more favor

than the one who flatters with the tongue.

28:24 The one who robs his father and mother and says, “There is no transgression,”

is a companion to the one who destroys.

28:25 The greedy person stirs up dissension,

but the one who trusts in the Lord will prosper.

28:26 The one who trusts in his own heart is a fool,

but the one who walks in wisdom will escape.

28:27 The one who gives to the poor will not lack,

but whoever shuts his eyes to them will receive many curses.

28:28 When the wicked gain control, people hide themselves,

but when they perish, the righteous increase.

Proverbs
Chapter 29

29:1 The one who stiffens his neck after numerous rebukes

will suddenly be destroyed without remedy.

29:2 When the righteous become numerous, the people rejoice;

when the wicked rule, the people groan.

29:3 The man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,

but whoever associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth.

29:4 A king brings stability to a land by justice,

but one who exacts tribute tears it down.

29:5 The one who flatters his neighbor

spreads a net for his steps.

29:6 In the transgression of an evil person there is a snare,

but a righteous person can sing and rejoice.

29:7 The righteous person cares for the legal rights of the poor;

the wicked does not understand such knowledge.

29:8 Scornful people inflame a city,

but those who are wise turn away wrath.

29:9 If a wise person goes to court with a foolish person,

there is no peace whether he is angry or laughs. 

29:10 Bloodthirsty people hate someone with integrity;

as for the upright, they seek his life.

29:11 A fool lets fly with all his temper,

but a wise person keeps it back.

29:12 If a ruler listens to lies,

all his ministers will be wicked.

29:13 The poor person and the oppressor have this in common:

the Lord gives light to the eyes of them both.

29:14 If a king judges the poor in truth,

his throne will be established forever.

29:15 A rod and reproof impart wisdom,

but a child who is unrestrained brings shame to his mother.

29:16 When the wicked increase, transgression increases,

but the righteous will see their downfall.

29:17 Discipline your child, and he will give you rest;

he will bring you happiness.

29:18 When there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint,

but the one who keeps the law, blessed is he!

29:19 A servant cannot be corrected by words,

for although he understands, there is no answer.

29:20 Do you see someone who is hasty in his words?

There is more hope for a fool than for him.

29:21 If someone pampers his servant from youth,

he will be a weakling in the end.

29:22 An angry person stirs up dissension,

and a wrathful person is abounding in transgression.

29:23 A person’s pride will bring him low,

but one who has a lowly spirit will gain honor.

29:24 Whoever shares with a thief is his own enemy;

he hears the oath to testify, but does not talk.

29:25 The fear of people becomes a snare,

but whoever trusts in the Lord will be set on high.

29:26 Many people seek the face of a ruler,

but it is from the Lord that one receives justice.

29:27 An unjust person is an abomination to the righteous,

and the one who lives an upright life is an abomination to the wicked.

Proverbs
Chapter 30

The Words of Agur

30:1 The words of Agur, the son of Jakeh; an oracle:

This man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ukal: 

30:2 Surely I am more brutish than any other human being,

and I do not have human understanding;

30:3 I have not learned wisdom,

nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One.

30:4 Who has ascended into heaven, and then descended?

Who has gathered up the winds in his fists?

Who has bound up the waters in his cloak?

Who has established all the ends of the earth?

What is his name, and what is his son’s name? – if you know!

30:5 Every word of God is purified;

he is like a shield for those who take refuge in him.

30:6 Do not add to his words,

lest he reprove you, and prove you to be a liar.

30:7 Two things I ask from you;

do not refuse me before I die:

30:8 Remove falsehood and lies far from me;

do not give me poverty or riches,

feed me with my allotted portion of bread,

30:9 lest I become satisfied and act deceptively

and say, “Who is the Lord?”

Or lest I become poor and steal

and demean the name of my God.

30:10 Do not slander a servant to his master,

lest he curse you, and you are found guilty.

30:11 There is a generation who curse their fathers

and do not bless their mothers.

30:12 There is a generation who are pure in their own eyes

and yet are not washed from their filthiness.

30:13 There is a generation whose eyes are so lofty,

and whose eyelids are lifted up disdainfully.

30:14 There is a generation whose teeth are like swords

and whose molars are like knives

to devour the poor from the earth

and the needy from among the human race.

30:15 The leech has two daughters:

“Give! Give!”

There are three things that are never satisfied,

four that never say, “Enough” – 

30:16 the grave, the barren womb,

land that is not satisfied with water,

and fire that never says, “Enough!”

30:17 The eye that mocks at a father

and despises obeying a mother – 

the ravens of the valley will peck it out

and the young vultures will eat it.

30:18 There are three things that are too wonderful for me,

four that I do not understand: 

30:19 the way of an eagle in the sky,

the way of a snake on a rock,

the way of a ship in the sea,

and the way of a man with a woman.

30:20 This is the way of an adulterous woman:

she eats and wipes her mouth

and says, “I have not done wrong.”

30:21 Under three things the earth trembles,

and under four things it cannot bear up:

30:22 under a servant who becomes king,

under a fool who is stuffed with food,

30:23 under an unloved woman who is married,

and under a female servant who dispossesses her mistress.

30:24 There are four things on earth that are small,

but they are exceedingly wise:

30:25 ants are creatures with little strength,

but they prepare their food in the summer;

30:26 rock badgers are creatures with little power,

but they make their homes in the crags;

30:27 locusts have no king,

but they all go forward by ranks;

30:28 a lizard you can catch with the hand,

but it gets into the palaces of the king.

30:29 There are three things that are magnificent in their step,

four things that move about magnificently:

30:30 a lion, mightiest of the beasts,

who does not retreat from anything;

30:31 a strutting rooster, a male goat,

and a king with his army around him.

30:32 If you have done foolishly by exalting yourself

or if you have planned evil,

put your hand over your mouth!

30:33 For as the churning of milk produces butter

and as punching the nose produces blood,

so stirring up anger produces strife.

Proverbs
Chapter 31

The Words of Lemuel

31:1 The words of King Lemuel,

an oracle that his mother taught him:

31:2 O my son, O son of my womb,

O son of my vows,

31:3 Do not give your strength to women,

nor your ways to that which ruins kings.

31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel,

it is not for kings to drink wine,

or for rulers to crave strong drink,

31:5 lest they drink and forget what is decreed,

and remove from all the poor their legal rights.

31:6 Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,

and wine to those who are bitterly distressed;

31:7 let them drink and forget their poverty,

and remember their misery no more.

31:8 Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak,

for the legal rights of all the dying.

31:9 Open your mouth, judge in righteousness,

and plead the cause of the poor and needy.

The Wife of Noble Character

31:10 Who can find a wife of noble character? 

For her value is far more than rubies.

31:11 The heart of her husband has confidence in her,

and he has no lack of gain.

31:12 She brings him good and not evil

all the days of her life. 

31:13 She obtains wool and flax,

and she is pleased to work with her hands.

31:14 She is like the merchant ships;

she brings her food from afar.

31:15 She also gets up while it is still night,

and provides food for her household and a portion to her female servants.

31:16 She considers a field and buys it;

from her own income she plants a vineyard.

31:17 She begins her work vigorously,

and she strengthens her arms.

31:18 She knows that her merchandise is good,

and her lamp does not go out in the night.

31:19 Her hands take hold of the distaff,

and her hands grasp the spindle.

31:20 She extends her hand to the poor,

and reaches out her hand to the needy.

31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household,

for all of her household are clothed with scarlet.

31:22 She makes for herself coverlets;

her clothing is fine linen and purple.

31:23 Her husband is well-known in the city gate

when he sits with the elders of the land.

31:24 She makes linen garments and sells them,

and supplies the merchants with sashes.

31:25 She is clothed with strength and honor,

and she can laugh at the time to come.

31:26 She opens her mouth with wisdom,

and loving instruction is on her tongue.

31:27 She watches over the ways of her household,

and does not eat the bread of idleness.

31:28 Her children rise up and call her blessed,

her husband also praises her:

31:29 “Many daughters have done valiantly,

but you surpass them all!” 

31:30 Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting,

but a woman who fears the Lord will be praised.

31:31 Give her credit for what she has accomplished,

and let her works praise her in the city gates.
