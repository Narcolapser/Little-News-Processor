<p><font size="6">Proverbs<br/>Chapter 27<br/>27:1 Do not boast about tomorrow;<br/>for you do not know what a day may bring forth.<br/>27:2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;<br/>someone else, and not your own lips. <br/>27:3 A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,<br/>but vexation by a fool is more burdensome than the two of them.<br/>27:4 Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming,<br/>but who can stand before jealousy?<br/>27:5 Better is open rebuke<br/>than hidden love.<br/>27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend,<br/>but the kisses of an enemy are excessive.<br/>27:7 The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey,<br/>but to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet.<br/>27:8 Like a bird that wanders from its nest,<br/>so is a person who wanders from his home.<br/>27:9 Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice,<br/>likewise the sweetness of one’s friend from sincere counsel.<br/>27:10 Do not forsake your friend and your father’s friend,<br/>and do not enter your brother’s house in the day of your disaster;<br/>a neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away.<br/>27:11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,<br/>so that I may answer anyone who taunts me.<br/>27:12 A shrewd person sees danger and hides himself,<br/>but the naive keep right on going and suffer for it.<br/>27:13 Take a man’s garment when he has given security for a stranger,<br/>and when he gives surety for a stranger, hold him in pledge.<br/>27:14 If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,<br/>it will be counted as a curse to him.<br/>27:15 A continual dripping on a rainy day<br/>and a contentious wife are alike.<br/>27:16 Whoever hides her hides the wind<br/>or grasps oil with his right hand.<br/>27:17 As iron sharpens iron,<br/>so a person sharpens his friend.<br/>27:18 The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,<br/>and whoever takes care of his master will be honored.<br/>27:19 As in water the face is reflected as a face,<br/>so a person’s heart reflects the person. <br/>27:20 As Death and Destruction are never satisfied,<br/>so the eyes of a person are never satisfied.<br/>27:21 As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold,<br/>so a person is proved by the praise he receives.<br/>27:22 If you should pound the fool in the mortar<br/>among the grain with the pestle,<br/>his foolishness would not depart from him.<br/>27:23 Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks,<br/>give careful attention to your herds,<br/>27:24 for riches do not last forever,<br/>nor does a crown last from generation to generation.<br/>27:25 When the hay is removed and new grass appears,<br/>and the grass from the hills is gathered in,<br/>27:26 the lambs will be for your clothing,<br/>and the goats will be for the price of a field.<br/>27:27 And there will be enough goat’s milk for your food,<br/>for the food of your household,<br/>and for the sustenance of your servant girls.<br/><br/></font></p>

<p><font size="6">1 Samuel<br/>Chapter 27<br/><br/>David Aligns Himself with the Philistines<br/><br/>27:1 David thought to himself, “One of these days I’m going to be swept away by the hand of Saul! There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of searching for me through all the territory of Israel and I will escape from his hand.”<br/><br/>27:2 So David left and crossed over to King Achish son of Maoch of Gath accompanied by his six hundred men. 27:3 David settled with Achish in Gath, along with his men and their families. David had with him his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite, Nabal’s widow. 27:4 When Saul learned that David had fled to Gath, he did not mount a new search for him.<br/><br/>27:5 David said to Achish, “If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the country towns so that I can live there. Why should your servant settle in the royal city with you?” 27:6 So Achish gave him Ziklag on that day. (For that reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until this very day.) 27:7 The length of time that David lived in the Philistine countryside was a year and four months.<br/><br/>27:8 Then David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (They had been living in that land for a long time, from the approach to Shur as far as the land of Egypt.) 27:9 When David would attack a district, he would leave neither man nor woman alive. He would take sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing and would then go back to Achish. 27:10 When Achish would ask, “Where did you raid today?” David would say, “The Negev of Judah” or “The Negev of Jeharmeel” or “The Negev of the Kenites.” 27:11 Neither man nor woman would David leave alive so as to bring them back to Gath. He was thinking, “This way they can’t tell on us, saying, ‘This is what David did.’” Such was his practice the entire time that he lived in the country of the Philistines. 27:12 So Achish trusted David, thinking to himself, “He is really hated among his own people in Israel! From now on he will be my servant.”<br/></font></p>
